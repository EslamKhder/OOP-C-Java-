 Create   a  SavingsAccount   class.  Use   a   static   data  member  annualInterestRate tostore  
the annual interest rate for each of the savers. Each member of the class 
containsa private data member savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has ondeposit. 
Provide member function calculateMonthlyInterest that calculates the monthlyinterest by multiplying the  balance  by  annualInterestRate  
divided  by  12;  this  interestshould     be     added     to   savingsBalance.     
Provide   a   static   member   functionmodifyInterestRate that sets the static annualInterestRate to a new value. 
Write a driverprogram   to   test   class   SavingsAccount.   Instantiate   two   different   objects   of   classSavingsAccount,   
saver1   and   saver2,   with   balances   of   $2000.00   and   $3000.00,respectively.   Set   the   annualInterestRate   to   3   percent.   
Then   calculate   the   monthlyinterest   and   print   the   new   balances   
for   each   of   the   savers.   Then   set   theannualInterestRate to 4 percent, calculate the next month's 
interest and print the newbalances for each of the savers
